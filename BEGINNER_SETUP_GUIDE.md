# üöÄ Complete Beginner's Setup Guide for Yourja

## What You're Going to Do

You're going to make a blockchain app that:
- Lets people connect their crypto wallets (like MetaMask)
- Shows their token balances (fake money for now)
- Lets them "buy" vouchers with tokens
- All transactions happen on the blockchain (like a public ledger)

## üìã What You Need Before Starting

### 1. Install Required Software
**You need these programs on your computer:**

1. **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime)
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the "LTS" version (green button)
   - Install it (click Next, Next, Next...)
   - Open terminal/command prompt and type: `node --version`
   - You should see something like `v18.17.0`

2. **MetaMask Browser Extension**
   - Go to: https://metamask.io/
   - Click "Download" ‚Üí "Install MetaMask for Chrome/Firefox"
   - Create a new wallet (SAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE SAFELY!)
   - Remember your wallet password

3. **Code Editor (Optional but helpful)**
   - Download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - This makes editing code easier

## üéØ STEP 1: Get Your Project Ready

### 1.1 Download Your Code
```bash
# Open terminal/command prompt
# Navigate to where you want the project (like Desktop)
cd Desktop

# Download your project
git clone https://github.com/arna-v26/project-yourja-38865
cd project-yourja-38865
```

### 1.2 Install Project Dependencies
```bash
# This downloads all the code libraries your project needs
npm install
```
*This will take 2-3 minutes. You'll see lots of text scrolling.*

### 1.3 Create Your Environment File
```bash
# Copy the example file to create your real config file
cp .env.example .env
```

**What just happened?** You created a file called `.env` that will store your secret keys and settings.
